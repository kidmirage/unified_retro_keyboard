// This file supplies the Apple 2 ASCII keyboard keymap.  Two variants are provided:
//
// 1) An Upper/Lowercase variant. This variant moves the @ and ^ symbols from
//    the P and N keys to the REPEAT key, since the P and N keys need to reserve
//    the shifted value for the uppercase characters. Also, the "Power" key
//    doubles as a caps-lock key.
//
// 2) A CAPS only keyboard, following the standard Apple II conventions and
//    layout, with ^ above the N key and @ above the P key, and a functioning
//    REPEAT key.
//
// For both variants, CTRL+RESET is required for a system reset.
